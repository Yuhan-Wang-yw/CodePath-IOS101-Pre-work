Think of an app idea that you would like to build.
It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. 
Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. 

App idea:
I would like to build an app that allows people to create virtual galleries easily. This will enable an interactive map or a 3d tour of a gallery you can build just by putting the works you want into a space in certain orders. It could be installations, drawings, pictures, your own objects, literally anything. And then the app will generate a virtual view of the gallery. I want the app to allow everyone to curate their own exihibition.
